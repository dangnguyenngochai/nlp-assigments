These are some assignments that I did during my NLP Master Course at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology
- [1970513_Assignment3](1970513_Assignment3/) is an implementations of using different word embeddings for doing classification on news topics using their content, the word embeddings include tf-idf, auto-encoder, w2v

- [1970513_LanguageModel](1970513_LanguageModel/) is a Vietnamese name Spell Checker and Correction, whose description can be found in the report file. The implementation include 2 model: bidirectional and vanilla RNN, whose architectures can also be found in the report
